glimpse (4.18.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * glimpse is now free software and finally ready to be part of main.
	  this package ships the agrep program and therefore the package
		currently conflicts with the "agrep" package in non-free (which also
		provides agrep).
	
  * the undocumented internal programs cast, uncast, buildcast, tbuild,
	  and wgconvert are installed in /usr/lib/glimpse.
